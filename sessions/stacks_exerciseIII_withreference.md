# Assembly without a reference genome

**Developed by:** Julian Catchen, Nicolas Rochette

**Adapted by:** Ludovic Dutoit

### Goals
  
  - Learn to call SNPs with a reference genome

### Introduction

make sure we get the structure and the vcf output earlier

RUN IT WITH A REFERENCE GENOME, WHY IS IT DIFFERENT HOW IS IT BETTER.

FIRST MAPPING

THEN USING STACKS

MAPPING CAN BE DONE BY ANY SOFTWARE OF YOUR CHOICE, IN OUR CASE WE USED BWA

THE FILES HAVE BEEN MAPPED WITH YOU BUT YOU CAN SEE AN EXAMPLE MAPPING SCRIPT [HERE](LINKED TO MAPPING).

### Run Stacks with a reference genome

In the folder ... create output_refmap.

we'll use the same samples, but mapped ...

create a link (*hint* ln -s /.../../ .)

refmap_map.pl options (notice how ...).

For the sake of this exercise, we won't adjust parameters except the -r 80...
