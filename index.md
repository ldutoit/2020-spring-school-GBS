# Genotyping-by-Sequencing in Ecology and Evolution:

### Practical workshop on the analysis of reduced representation libraries using Stacks

November 25 2020 | Ludovic Dutoit and Alana Alexander

## Description
With the age of high\-throughput sequencing, several techniques have been developed to
genotype thousands of markers across hundreds of individuals at relatively low\-cost. One
group of those methods, Genotyping\-by\-Sequencing (GBS) cuts down on the amount of the genome sequenced
by using restriction enzymes to repeatedly sequence the same genomic locations across
individuals. The thousands of loci sequenced can bring high resolution to population
genomic or phylogenomic analyses at a fraction of the cost associated with whole genome
sequencing.

This one day workshop is designed to show how to process GBS/RAD data through
hands\-on analysis using the Stacks software pipeline.
